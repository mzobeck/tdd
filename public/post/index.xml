&lt;img src=&#34;/2020/11/27/gccp1-2/index.en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ghccpod.com/gccp-edge1/&#34;&gt;The following originally appeared on my podcast about global PHO - Global Health and Childhood Cancer&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is part two of a three part essay about the global burden of childhood cancer. (If you haven’t read the first part about the mber of new cases per year)[], you may want to read that first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-probability-of-surviving-cancer&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The probability of surviving cancer&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers mentioned in the last post did not stop at estimating incident cases and non-diagnosed cases, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ghccpod.com/12-the-missing-3-million/&#34;&gt;they also estimated the chance a child has of surviving their cancer after being diagnosed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(^2\)&lt;/span&gt; Using methods similar to how they estimated new cases, the researchers reported that 37% of all patients with cancer survive for 5 years after diagnosis (5 years from diagnosis is chosen as a convenient time point for measurement purposes, but there is nothing special about it). Again, we could say, with some rounding, that on average &lt;strong&gt;around the world only 4 in 10 kids survive their cancer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the incident cases, this estimate is actually very different in different parts of the world, except variability of the survival estimates is even larger than the incidence estimates. For instance, the 5-year survival percentage in a high-income country like North America is 83% (more than 8 in 10!), but in an economically-challenged region like eastern Africa, only &lt;strong&gt;8% of all patients survive (roughly 1 in 10).&lt;/strong&gt; Looking broadly across all countries, the trend that emerges from the data is that kids in LMIC have a much, much lower chance of surviving their disease. As an example, &lt;strong&gt;figure 4&lt;/strong&gt; shows the percent of mortality by region for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a cancer of the blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;fig.-4---animated&#34; class=&#34;section level6&#34;&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Fig. 4 - Animated&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/2020/11/27/gccp1-2/index.en_files/figure-html/survial%20examples-1.gif&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/2020/11/27/gccp1-2/index.en_files/figure-html/survial%20examples%20static-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these numbers were not depressing enough, there is a twist to the story. These survival estimates are only for patients who are &lt;em&gt;diagnosed&lt;/em&gt; with cancer. Remember earlier where we said 4 in 10 patients, on average, are not even diagnosed, and that this proportion is worse in LMIC? The patients who were not diagnosed were not factored in to the survival estimates. To get the true survival, we would have to consider what happens to the patients who are not diagnosed &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the patients who are diagnosed and treated. Let me give a very crude example of how we might combine these numbers. It is safe to assume that most patients who are not diagnosed will die from their disease, but to be conservative and factor in some uncertainty to the estimates, let us put the number for patients who are not diagnosed but survive at 10%. Suppose country A demonstrates a 5-year survival of 50% for disease X, but only 50% of kids who develop the disease are diagnosed. The total number who survive would be (0.5 x 0.5) + (0.1 x 0.5) = 0.30 or 30%. The specifics of the math aren’t too important, what is important is that factoring in non-diagnosis drops the survival rate by a large amount. Unfortunately, since patients in LMIC are both less likely to be diagnosed &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; less likely to survive, looking at the data in this way worsens the numbers of LMICs more than HICs. &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5&lt;/strong&gt; shows the new estimates when factoring non-diagnosis into the equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;fig.-5---animated&#34; class=&#34;section level6&#34;&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Fig. 5 - Animated&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/2020/11/27/gccp1-2/index.en_files/figure-html/nondiagnosis%20AND%20mortality-animated-1.gif&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/2020/11/27/gccp1-2/index.en_files/figure-html/nondiagnosis%20AND%20mortality-static-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For comparison, here are the two static graphs side-by-side when non-diagnosis is not included (left) and when it is (right). You can see the number of who die does not increase much for North America and Europe when includiding non-diagnosis due to the simple fact that most patients are diagnosed. The numbers increase significantly for the rest of the regions, representing high rates of patients who are not diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;row&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;col-md-6&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/2020/11/27/gccp1-2/index.en_files/figure-html/compare%20all%20survival-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;col-md-6&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/2020/11/27/gccp1-2/index.en_files/figure-html/compare%20all%20and%20nondiagnosis%20survival-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Important technical note: It bears repeating that these calculations are very imprecise and there is unaccounted for uncertainty that makes them more difficult to combine than the above procedure suggests. I am using point estimates for the sake of clarity and ignoring the intervals of uncertainty associated with the estimates. These numbers are only for the purpose of illustrating the relationship between income category, non-diagnosis, and survival and should not be reported as precise estimates.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that wasn’t enough, there is actually a further twist to the story. The estimates for both incident cases and survival &lt;em&gt;are for patients ages 0-14 years only&lt;/em&gt;. We should keep in mind that many 15-19 year-olds that develop cancers are considered to be “pediatric” patients that pediatric oncologists (at least in the United States, where I work) will treat. There is even a name for a unique category of patients that includes this age group called “Adolescent and Young Adults”. We won’t go into more detail of this age group because less reliable information is available (an example of problem number 2 in quantifying disease burden from earlier!), but it is important to know that these patients are not included in the above discussion, and the true number of pediatric patients is higher as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the GPO community has come a long way in quantifying incident cancer cases and 5-year survival, and the story the numbers tell is grim. However, there is another part of the story that needs to be told, that of measuring disease burden from the perspective of the suffering it causes and the years of life it steals from its victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;/2020/11/27/the-global-childhood-cancer-puzzle-edge-1.1/index.en_files/anchor-sections/anchor-sections.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;img src=&#34;/2020/11/27/the-global-childhood-cancer-puzzle-edge-1.1/index.en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ghccpod.com/gccp-edge1/&#34;&gt;The following originally appeared on my podcast about global PHO - Global Health and Childhood Cancer&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-global-oncology-puzzle&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Global Oncology Puzzle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever completed a very difficult puzzle? Perhaps it was thousands of small pieces with colors that blend together, so that most of the pieces appeared very similar. Do you remember the overwhelmed feeling you had when you first dumped the pieces onto the table? “Good grief”, you may have thought, “this puzzle is impossible.” But, after the moment of defeat, you look at the picture on the box and see what the puzzle could be. Perhaps it will be an amazing waterfall, or city illuminated at night, or a basket full of kittens, and you know that at the end of all your hard work the pieces will come together, and the picture will be complete. So, thinking of that future day when you will feel the satisfying snap of the last piece falling into place, you sit down and get to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many people, global pediatric oncology (GPO) is like a giant, overwhelming puzzle. The complexity of the problem and the way the pieces are scattered may leave one feeling lost how to begin. However, despite its difficulty, a community of dedicated doctors, nurses, cancer survivors, parents, politicians, and many others has been working to solve it. Over the last three decades, this community has made considerable progress toward understanding the necessary conditions for successful childhood cancer treatment anywhere in the world. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ghccpod.com/the-transformative-perspective/&#34;&gt;Now, new research has completely changed the perception of childhood cancer as a global health concern&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of this new information, the shape of the puzzle is changing. Whereas before, many pieces had been put together, but there was no structure that unified the whole, now most of the edge pieces are in place, and the outline of the puzzle can be seen in its entirety. The edges have given the puzzle a definite structure, which helps the global oncology community understand both how the different completed parts sit in relation to each other and what important information is still missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a series of essays, I want to present to you a broad understanding of what I’m calling the edges of the GPO puzzle: those essential concepts without which one cannot fully understand pediatric oncology as a global health concern. Concretely, we will review the emerging research that clarifies the magnitude of the problem of childhood cancer, demonstrates effective solutions exist that can save lives today, quantifies the costs associated with treatment, and charts a clear path forward. To discuss the first edge, we will directly address the question, “what is the global burden of pediatric cancer?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the information in these essays will not be new to people who are involved in the field. Even if he or she hasn’t read the research, much of it is in line with the experience and intuition of the GPO community. If you consider yourself in this group, my hope is that you take from these essays a distilled set of concepts that can serve as visual and viral representations of the field, which you can use to communicate its importance to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the interested but unfamiliar reader, this information may be surprising. When one sits down at the table to work on the puzzle and looks at the chaos of the scattered pieces, it’s easy to be overwhelmed. This feeling may even be accompanied by belief in the futility of completing the puzzle. I have certainly had the thought that the goal of successfully treating children with cancer anywhere in the world is too complex, too big, and too expensive. It also may be hard to see how you can contribute to completing the puzzle. Being overwhelmed at the problem is understandable, which is why I hope to demonstrate that significant progress has already been made and more lives can be saved, through the GPO community’s tireless efforts in caring for kids, an effort in which anyone can take part&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that said, let’s go tackle the first edge. I’ll address the rest of the edges in future essays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/2020/11/27/the-global-childhood-cancer-puzzle-edge-1.1/index.en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;edge-1-the-global-burden-of-pediatric-cancer&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Edge #1: The Global Burden of Pediatric Cancer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one would deny that childhood cancer is a terrible disease, and people broadly agree that it is horrible that children have to endure it. However, it is also a rare disease, and one may justly wonder how big a problem it is compared to the many other concerning diseases that confront the global health community. This is a reasonable question that serves as the starting place for constructing a more complete picture of GPO. In this visual essay will ask and answer the question &lt;strong&gt;what is the total burden of disease due to pediatric cancer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent research has provided a striking answer to this question, which is: &lt;em&gt;a whole lot more than we previously thought&lt;/em&gt;! I’ll explain what this surprising answer means in a minute, but first let me explain why this question is very difficult to answer and why the global cancer community’s understanding of disease burden is changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-do-you-measure-cancer-burden&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How do you measure cancer burden?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we answer this question? Should we count the total number of kids diagnosed with cancer who are alive in the world right now? Or maybe we should only count new cases this year? Maybe we should we look at the total number of deaths due to cancer this year? But what about the kids who develop cancer but are never diagnosed, how do we measure those cases if we don’t directly count them? Also, cancer causes much more suffering than just loss of life. Is there a way to factor in the amount of suffering when trying to quantify the burden of disease? You can see from these questions that the first thing researchers must do is to decide what aspect of &lt;em&gt;cancer burden&lt;/em&gt; is worth measuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These questions are very difficult for researchers to answer for a single country, and they are even more complex when considering the entire world. To answer these questions correctly, researchers require a large amount of information. It would be nice if complete data about the number of cancer diagnoses or deaths due to cancer were available, but the unfortunate truth is that there are many holes in the available data. Comprehensive data collection requires a large and expensive system, and there are many countries that are limited in their ability to start and maintain one. Other countries track cases diagnosed at different hospitals, but they do not count every hospital and every patient in the country, so their numbers are also incomplete. To make things even more complicated, researchers know that many cases around the world are not even diagnosed, and if they are to produce reliable numbers about the amount of pediatric cancer in the world, then they must be able to measure the cases they know are happening but never identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From these problems, you can see that there are two big reasons why quantifying cancer burden is hard to do:
1. We could measure it in different ways that mean different things.
2. We are missing much of the information we need to make good measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of these difficulties, estimates of the total burden of childhood cancer have changed over the years. The GPO community has worked hard to improve their methods, and we now have more reliable numbers that tell a very surprising story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-is-the-total-burden-of-disease-due-to-pediatric-cancer&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is the total burden of disease due to pediatric cancer?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said above, the answer from our improved estimates is: &lt;strong&gt;there is a whole lot more cancer than we previously thought&lt;/strong&gt;! Let me explain what has changed and why this is so surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-total-number-of-new-cases-every-year&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The total number of new cases every year&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the limitations in measuring cancer burden previously described, the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; estimates for how many children from the age 0-14 developed cancer each year was 200,000. The technical term for this measure is &lt;a href=&#34;https://sph.unc.edu/files/2015/07/nciph_ERIC1.pdf&#34;&gt;incident cases&lt;/a&gt;. However, recently &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ghccpod.com/12-the-missing-3-million/&#34;&gt;researchers developed a new method to estimate incident cases and reported that there are in fact 400,000 children who develop cancer every year&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, the previous estimates were half as much as the newer estimate (see &lt;strong&gt;figure 1&lt;/strong&gt;)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;fig.-1---animated&#34; class=&#34;section level6&#34;&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Fig. 1 - Animated&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/2020/11/27/the-global-childhood-cancer-puzzle-edge-1.1/index.en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.gif&#34; /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are the numbers so different? Part of the reason is the way the researchers calculated the number of cases for countries with missing data by comparing them to the number of cases for countries with really good data differently than previous estimates. Also, with the newer method, researchers were able to better account for the patients who developed cancer but were never diagnosed. Previous methods had trouble estimating this number well, but the new method is much better at it. In fact, the researchers found that about &lt;em&gt;175,000&lt;/em&gt; kids with cancer are not even diagnosed every year! That means they develop cancer, but either they never seek medical care or the fact that they have cancer is never recognized by healthcare personnel. Another way to look at this number is that more than 4 out of every 10 kids with cancer in the world are never diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These numbers summarize what we know about the number of new cases per year for the entire world. We can say that the average proportion of kids who are not diagnosed is 4 out of 10. However, that actual proportion of kids who are not diagnosed in a &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; country or regions can be very different. For example, the researchers estimated that in western Africa 57% of cases, almost 6 out of every 10 children with cancer, were never diagnosed and in south Asia it was 5 out of 10 kids. &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2&lt;/strong&gt; shows the estimates of total number of new cases per year by different region and how many cases are diagnosed and undiagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;fig.-2---animated&#34; class=&#34;section level6&#34;&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Fig. 2 - Animated&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/2020/11/27/the-global-childhood-cancer-puzzle-edge-1.1/index.en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.gif&#34; /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the researchers looked at the trends in proportion of kids who are diagnosed across countries, they noticed that countries that are more economically challenged, labeled as &lt;a href=&#34;https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups&#34;&gt;low-income and middle-income countries&lt;/a&gt; (LMIC for short), tend to have higher proportions of kids with cancer who are not diagnosed. This is an important fact to notice because &lt;em&gt;9 out of every 10 kids with cancer in the world live in LMICs!&lt;/em&gt; Putting these pieces of evidence together, &lt;strong&gt;we can say that the vast majority of children who develop cancer live in countries where they have a high chance of never being diagnosed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers of this paper didn’t stop with these estimates. They calculate that if the rates for non-diagnosis do not change between 2015 and 2030, then about 3 million children will not receive a diagnosis for their life-threatening disease. &lt;em&gt;3 million children&lt;/em&gt;, most with diseases that can be cured, will never have the opportunity to receive treatment, never have the chance at living a long healthy life, and never even know what was breaking their bodies. This is a daily average around 550 nondiagnosed children with cancer. To put this in perspective, if an average school bus holds 55 kids, then this number is the rough equivalent of &lt;strong&gt;10 school buses filled with children driving away and disappearing every single day for 15 years.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Technical Note: it is worth pointing out that the numbers mentioned above and below are estimates and there is a degree of uncertainty about them that is not represented in the displayed data. The fact of the matter is that the lack of reliable data leaves a lot of questions. For instance, only 5% of kid in Africa live in countries with comprehensive registries. How do we decide what to do with the remaining 95%? The researches mentioned above had a specific modeling strategy to fill in the gaps, but that is not the only way. For instance the &lt;a href=&#34;http://iicc.iarc.fr/about/iicc3_highlights.php&#34;&gt;International Incidence of Childhood Cancer (IICC3)&lt;/a&gt; has a different methodolgy that produces slightly different numbers. For the purposes of this essay it is sufficient to acknowledge these difference, and continue exploring the estimates the Harvard researchers produced.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ghccpod.com/gccp-edge1/&#34;&gt;The following originally appeared on my podcast about global PHO - Global Health and Childhood Cancer&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is part three of a three part essay about the global burden of childhood cancer. (If you haven’t read the first part about the mber of new cases per year)[], you may want to read that first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;measuring-the-health-consequences-of-cancer&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Measuring the health consequences of cancer&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s think for a minute what the measures that we’ve discussed are telling us. Incident cases tells us about the number of new cases that occur in the world and survival tells us the final outcome for someone who has the disease. These measures tell us about the beginning and the end of the cancer journey, but there are many things that happen between those two points that are worth measuring, particularly the suffering and loss of wellbeing that result from cancer. Now you may be wondering, “how in the world do we measure loss of wellbeing? Loss compared to what?” The answer is that researchers measure it against &lt;em&gt;the expected level of health for a patient if they never developed cancer&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me provide an example to clarify these concepts. Suppose there is a restaurant with 100 people eating in it. Suppose most people have a lovely time drinking and chatting with friends; however, ten unlucky people order the chicken special that was undercooked by the chef and immediately get terrible food poisoning. If we were interested in quantifying the burden of food poisoning in our 100 patrons, we could say the number of incident cases was 10 per evening at the restaurant. Also suppose, tragically, 2 people out of the 10 cases die from their food poisoning but the rest survive and completely recover. Both die within the first month, so that seems like a good timeframe for reference. We can say that 1-month survival of this terrible food poisoning is 8 in 10 or 80%. These numbers give us a good snapshot of the situation, but there is still something missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever had food poisoning, then you know that there is much more to the experience than these number describe. The illness can bring terrible stomach pains, vomiting, and other messy symptoms. The suffering from it can be intense and may last a few hours to weeks. Suppose you were one of the people who got food poisoning at this restaurant and then recovered. If someone described the impact of the disease as, “10 people got sick that night and 2 died”, you would think this does not describe the experience well for you or anyone else who got sick. To better capture the experience of the illness, the suffering it causes seems like an important part to describe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To measure this experience, researchers have developed a tool called the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/metrics_daly/en/&#34;&gt;“Disability-Adjusted Life Year”, or DALY for short&lt;/a&gt;. DALYs quantify suffering along two dimensions, the &lt;em&gt;loss of wellbeing&lt;/em&gt; for patients living with a disease and the &lt;em&gt;years of life lost&lt;/em&gt; for patients who die from it. Let’s take these one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To measure &lt;em&gt;loss of wellbeing&lt;/em&gt; (technical term: &lt;em&gt;the years lived with disability&lt;/em&gt;), researchers have to first decide what is normal wellbeing. They can make the assumption that, roughly speaking, people who never develop the disease and have similar health to the patient &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the patient is diagnosed can act as a good point of reference for the health the patient &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; have experienced &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; the patient never developed the disease in the first place. Then they measure the actual health of the patient with the disease against the healthy people. There are many conditional assumptions in this concept, which makes it confusing. We can simplify it to say that researchers measure the difference in health between people without the disease and a person with the disease. How do you put a number on the health state of a person with a disease? The most common way researchers do this is they ask a bunch of people to rate different states of health relative to full health and then they decide on an average “value” of the diseased health state relative to healthy state. Then researchers subtract the “value” of the health state of a person with the disease from the “value” of full health over time to calculate an estimate of lost wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measuring &lt;em&gt;years of life lost&lt;/em&gt; is more straightforward. Researchers can say that the life expectancy (average lifespan) for a bunch of people similar to the patient but who do not have the disease is the life expectancy of the patient of the patient &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; they never developed the disease. Researchers then take the life expectancy and subtract the age at which a patient dies, and they have an estimate of the years of life that were lost due to the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 6&lt;/strong&gt; shows an example of the health states for three different types of people in our example. The top line is a healthy person who never develops food poisoning, the middle line is a perspon who develops food poisoning and then recovers, and the bottom line is a person who develops food poisoning and eventually dies. The difference in area between the top line and each of the other two lines are the &lt;em&gt;loss of wellbeing&lt;/em&gt; for those patients (pink colored areas on second row of figure 6). The difference between the life expectancy (blue line on the graph) and the age at which the bottom line reaches a health state of zero is the &lt;em&gt;years of life lost&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;/2020/11/27/gccp1-3/index.en_files/figure-html/DALY%20example%203-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we know how to measure DALYs, the next question is, “what are they used for?” DALYs allow for two important comparisons. The first is that they allow researchers to measure the consequences of a disease relative to where it occurs in a lifespan. The years of life lost for a person who is 100 years old and develops cancer compared to a person who is 5 years old are very different and DALYs give researchers a way to put a number on that difference. The second thing DALYs allow is the comparison of very different diseases. With them, we can think about questions such as, “how do the health consequences of a common cold compare to cancer”. Colds are very, very common, somewhat uncomfortable, and most of the time get better on their own. Cancer is the exact opposite. If we wanted to, we could calculate DALYs for each, which could allow us to compare the health consequences and burden of these two very difference diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to point out that DALYs are &lt;em&gt;very rough&lt;/em&gt; estimates of the experience of having a disease. They give researchers a way to put a number to this experience, so they can track it over time and compare it across other diseases. What DALYs are &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; is an actual statement about what living with cancer or any other disease is &lt;strong&gt;really like&lt;/strong&gt;. We could write a 10,000-page novel try to convey the true experience of just one child with cancer, and still not capture the truth. The experience of cancer is a profound trial to endure and no researcher wants to cheapen that. DALYs are imperfect tools used by limited humans to try to measure an experience that defies description for the sake of helping those experiencing it. Furthermore, there are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ghjournal.org/the-rise-critique-and-persistence-of-the-daly-in-global-health/#&#34;&gt;well known critiques of DALYs and what they do and do not measure&lt;/a&gt; that are worth exploring to better both what specifically they are measuring and what are their limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us now turn to measuring the burden childhood cancer using DALYs. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ghccpod.com/16-gbd/&#34;&gt;A group of researchers recently published the most comprehensive estimate of DALYs due to childhood cancer to date&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(^3\)&lt;/span&gt; The most important finding from this paper corrects a common wrong belief that goes “because childhood cancer is rare, its total burden is low compared to other diseases.” The researchers reported that childhood cancer caused &lt;strong&gt;11.5 million DALYs in 2017&lt;/strong&gt;. While this single number may be difficult to interpret, compared to the other most common childhood diseases, childhood cancer ranked 9th globally. In upper-middle income countries, it was the 3rd largest cause of DALYs, falling only behind congenital birth defects and lower respiratory infections. See &lt;strong&gt;figure 7&lt;/strong&gt; to see the comparisons. They also compared DALYs to adult cancers and found that, globally, childhood cancer ranks 6th among all types of cancers (see &lt;strong&gt;figure 8&lt;/strong&gt;) and in low and low-middle income countries, it is ranked 1st! Although childhood cancer is less common compared to other disease, the researchers demonstrated it is still responsible for a large amount of disease burden in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also looked at groups of countries in the world are most responsible for the greatest number of DALYs. The researches grouped countries by their “sustainable development index” (SDI), a number that gives a rough assessment of a country’s level of development. Consistent with the findings we’ve discussed so far, they found that lower SDI countries are responsible for the large majority of DALYs. &lt;strong&gt;Figure 9&lt;/strong&gt; shows total number of DALYs by SDI grou. In this figure, we again see the trend that the regions in the world that are least prosperous are the ones that suffer the highest burden of disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at GPO through the lens of DALYs not only helps us better understand the magnitude of the disease, but also informs discussion about how to set health priorities. The sad reality is that we live in a world of limited time, money, and resources. Because of these limitations, health officials, politicians, and other people who set healthcare policies in a country, have to make hard decisions about where to focus their efforts and resources. If decision makers do not have comprehensive information about the burden of diseases in their country, then they will not be able to make the best decision that will benefit the most people. As we have seen, comparisons of DALYs across diseases are a necessary measure to inform compassionate decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good example of this situation would be a health planner in an upper-middle income country that may need to decide whether to buy more cancer medicines or tuberculosis medicines for pediatric patients. According to the DALY estimates, for the average upper-middle income country pediatric cancer is the 3rd largest source of DALYs and tuberculosis is the 59th. This seems like an important piece of information for the health planner to know when making the decision. I’m certainly not saying that this is the only component to the decision. She would also need to consider costs, implementation feasibility, social context and a host of other factors that are not mentioned here. But I am saying that making the best decision that does the greatest amount of good is &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; difficult and can only be done when comprehensive information about the burden of the disease is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent time developing an intuition for what DALYs are because they are so important for understanding this edge of the GPO puzzle. Although more rare than other disease of childhood, it is responsible for &lt;em&gt;enormous suffering&lt;/em&gt; due to how lethal it is for young patients and how debilitating it can be for those who survive. DALYs help to describe what &lt;em&gt;should be the case&lt;/em&gt; - that in 2017 there should have been 11.5 million healthy life years lived that were not. Understanding what the world would look like if every child with cancer receives optimal care helps put the tragedy of GPO in a new perspective that better conveys the magnitude of the problem compared to only looking at the total number of new cases or deaths per year. Lastly, DALYs are helpful to understand because they play an important role in health policy and allow people who have to make really hard decisions to be well informed. Anyone interested in addressing GPO through advocacy and health policy need to be comfortable with these concepts so they can speak the same language as the decision makers they seek to impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;summary-of-edge-1-the-global-burden-of-childhood-cancer&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Summary of Edge #1 – The global burden of childhood cancer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve come a long way in this discussion. We saw that LMICs suffer the most from pediatric cancer, where 90% of children with cancer live. We established that GPO is much more common than was previously thought, with around 400,000 new cases of pediatric cancer per year. We also identified the ongoing catastrophe of non-diagnosis, which results in around 43% of kids with cancer, or 175,000 children, never even being diagnosed. If things do not change, in the next 15 years, 3 million children with cancer will never be diagnosed nor have a chance at cure - the equivalent of 10 school buses of children disappearing every day for 15 years. We also saw that the average 5-year survival around the world is about 37%, but ranges between 8% and 83% with the vast majority of low survival rates in LMICs. The picture only worsens when we add patients who are not diagnosed and the teenage AYA patients. Measuring DALYs due to cancer demonstrated that GPO sits among the top sources of ill health in the world, ranking number 9 globally for all pediatric diseases, number in 3 in middle-income countries, and number 6 globally when compared adult cancers. See table 1 for a summary of these numbers. Thanks to the hard work of the people in the GPO community, we now have a clear picture of the magnitude of the burden of childhood cancer. Fitting these pieces together has shown the world that the suffering due to GPO is enormous and needs to be addressed &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exploration of the burden of disease is the first edge in the childhood cancer puzzle. Now that we have an increasingly clear picture of how much cancer there is and the suffering it causes, the next question is what to do about it? It is natural to feel saddened and overwhelmed by these numbers, and it may seem as though the problem is too big to be fixed, but I have good news: for the last three decades, the GPO community has been demonstrating that we can improve care, and we now know the right intervention can &lt;em&gt;significantly&lt;/em&gt; improve survival in a short period of time. Answers already exist, it’s just a matter of putting the puzzle pieces together. How to improve outcomes is the second edge to the puzzle and will be the topic of the next visual essay.&lt;/p&gt;
