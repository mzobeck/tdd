I am a physician who cares for children with cancers and blood disorders around the world. One of my main areas of interest is leveraging technology to improve the delivery of medical care in low- and middle-income countries. I also research how to predict and prevent cancer treatment toxicities through statistical modeling. I love writing about and teaching Bayesian statistics. I'm also given to musing about the ontological, metaphysical, and epistemological foundations of science. You'll find some weird fusion of all of these things on this blog. Welcome!
