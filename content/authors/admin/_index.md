I am a physician who cares for children with cancers and blood disorders around the world. I research how to predict and prevent treatment-related toxicities. I also work on leveraging technology to improve how medical care is delivered in low- and middle-income countries. I love writing about and teaching Bayesian statistics. I also have been known to muse about the ontological and metaphysical foundations of science. You'll find some weird fusion of all of these things on this blog. Welcome!
