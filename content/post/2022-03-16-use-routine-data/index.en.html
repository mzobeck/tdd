<p>Global Health needs Data Science because efficient and effective healthcare delivery is the key to success.</p>
<p>Here are 10 examples of how Data Science capabilities can improve your organization’s operations and the care you provide to patients.</p>
<p>All of these ideas are possible to do well even if you don’t have an electronic medical record. All it takes is careful data collection of a limited number of variables. You don’t need big data to do Data Science successfully in Global Health, but you do need good data.</p>
